# Git GIF-STRAVAGANZA 
## For NTL-DS-103023

Today's challenge is to contribute to a Git repository, using branches and pull requests! We'll be using a *Git branching workflow* so we can all contribute to this same README file.

## Steps

1. Accept the invite to collaborate on this repository (should be an email sent to the email address associated with your GitHub account - will be sent out before the start of this Guided Session)
2. Clone down this repository (**don't fork it!**) to a good place on your computer (outside of the cohort reposistory)
3. Create a new branch on your local repository (I recommend naming your branch after yourself, so my branch will be named _Daniel_)
4. Find a GIF or image that summarizes how you're feeling today
5. Copy the appropriate **Share** link (use small size if possible)
5. Use Markdown syntax and a text editor to add the GIF or image to this README.md file **under your name** and commit your local changes to your branch
7. Push **your branch** to this repository (this step will not work if you forgot to checkout a branch in step 2!)
8. Start a pull request for me to review

I will either accept your pull request, or send you feedback on what you need to do to improve!

9. If needed make the necessary corrections and add, commit, push to your branch again
